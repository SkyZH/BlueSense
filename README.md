ðŸŒˆ BlueSense is a low-cost IoT platform for collecting and visualizing environment data. It has been collecting climate data in Shanghai for over 2 years.

## Demo site

Data are collected in my home in Shanghai, China. Note that since Firebase Realtime Database may not always be available in mainland China, it may take a long time to load the page.
